# Quasar Binaries with Periodic signal.

This project aims to find the Super massive Black Holes Binaries(SBHBs) by searching periodic signal in optical light curves.

## Getting started

### Installing

The easiest way to install all the packages is running the setup script in the main directory.

```
./setup.sh
``` 
This script should install python2.7 and the packages(like astroML,astropy...) used by the project. The python and packages are installed in the "package" dir, which is seperately from your original python packages.
